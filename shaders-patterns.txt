Often we need to draw specific patterns like stars, circles,light lenses,waves, etc.

It can be to see those patterns or to move the vertices

We could use textures but drawin the shape gives us more control

All we have are coordinates and our mathematical skills



We are goin to draw many patterns from very simple gradients to very complex perlin compositions

it's the perfect opportunity to practice and to learn how to use functions

This pattern is called perlin noise

Perlin noise can be used to recreate nature shapes like clouds, water,fire,terrain, elevation but it can also be used to aniamte the grass or snow moving in the wind


Let's use the cool uv gradient color we had at the beginning but with those patterns
